# **Introduction**

## Goals
This tutorial focuses on two goals:
*   Showing new users how to interact with Google Cloud Platform's Pub/Sub & BigQuery.
*   Serving as a refresher for experienced Google Cloud Platform users.


## The Approach

These goals will be achieved by exploring a practical and common use case implemented in Python that includes three primary stages: 

1.  Extracting data from a Pub/Sub subscription.
2.  Minimally transforming the data.
3.  Sending the data to a BigQuery table.
